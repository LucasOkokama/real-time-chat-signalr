# About the project
This is a simple real-time chat application built with ASP.NET Web API, SignalR and React. The goal of this project was to explore and learn more about SignalR and real-time communication. To keep things simple, all chat messages are stored in a dictionary, avoiding the need for a database. SignalR, which internally supports WebSockets when available, ensures instant message delivery between clients, making the chat experience seamless and responsive. Since the project doesn't rely on a database, it's easy to set up and run, making it ideal for quick prototyping or experimentation.

# Tech Stack
The project uses ASP.NET Web API for the backend, which handles HTTP requests and manages the real-time communication logic. It provides the necessary endpoints for clients to connect and exchange messages. SignalR is used to enable real-time communication between clients and the server. SignalR ensures instant message delivery by broadcasting messages to all connected users. It supports WebSockets when available, providing low-latency updates. The frontend is built with React, which dynamically updates the user interface as new messages arrive via SignalR. The UI allows users to send and receive messages in real time. Bootstrap is used for styling the chat interface, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing layout with minimal custom CSS.
